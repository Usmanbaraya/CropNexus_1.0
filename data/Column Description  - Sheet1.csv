Column ,Description 
Region,"The geographical area in Nigeria where the data was collected (e.g., North-Central, South-West). This affects climate, soil type, and crop suitability."
Soil Type ,"The classification of soil found in the region (e.g., Loamy, Sandy, Clay, Silt, Peaty). Different crops grow best in specific soil types."
Temperature (°C),"The average air temperature in the region (ranging from 20°C to 40°C). Temperature affects plant metabolism, growth, and stress resistance."
Rainfall (mm),The annual amount of rainfall in millimeters (ranging from 500 mm to 2000 mm). This helps determine water availability for crops.
Humidity (%),"The average humidity level in the air (ranging from 40% to 90%). High humidity can promote fungal diseases, while low humidity may cause drought stress."
pH Level,The soil’s acidity or alkalinity level (ranging from 4.5 to 7.5). Different crops require specific pH levels for nutrient absorption.
Sunlight Hours/Day,The number of hours of direct sunlight per day (ranging from 4 to 10 hours). Essential for photosynthesis and plant growth.
Soil Moisture (%),The percentage of water content in the soil (ranging from 10% to 80%). This helps determine irrigation needs.
Altitude (m),"The height above sea level in meters (ranging from 50m to 1000m). Altitude affects temperature, air pressure, and crop adaptability."
Slope/Topography ,"The land gradient where crops are planted (Low, Moderate, High). Slopes affect water drainage, erosion, and soil stability."
Crop Planted,"The specific crop planted in the region (e.g., Maize, Millet, Cocoa, Rice, Cassava, Groundnut, Tomato, Yam, Wheat, Sorghum)."
Maturation Period (Days) ,The number of days it takes for the crop to fully mature (ranges from 60 to 180 days). Helps in planning planting and harvesting schedules.
Crop Type,"The classification of the crop (e.g., Cereal, Grain, Cash Crop, Root, Legume, Vegetable). Helps categorize crops based on their economic and food value"
Soil Requirement,"The ideal soil condition for a given crop (e.g., Well-drained, Moist, Acidic Soil). Ensures crops get the best soil environment for growth."
Planting Season,"The best time of year to plant the crop (e.g., June-Aug, March-May, July-Sept, Oct-Dec, Jan-Feb). Based on seasonal climate patterns."
Irrigation Availability,Whether irrigation is available in the region (Yes/No). Determines if artificial watering is necessary.
Fertilizer Requirement,"The amount of fertilizer needed for optimal crop growth (Low, Medium, High). Helps optimize soil fertility management."
Pests/Disease Risk,"The likelihood of pest or disease issues in the region (Low, Medium, High). Helps in predicting crop vulnerability."
Market Demand (Price/kg),The current price per kilogram of the crop in the market (ranges from 100 NGN to 1000 NGN). Useful for economic decision-making.
Historical Yield (kg/ha),
